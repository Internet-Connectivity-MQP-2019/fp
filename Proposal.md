__Proposal:__ 

For our final project, we would like to build an interactive map as a prototype for our MQP. The MQP is mapping internet connectivity accross the US. One of our data gathering methods is to fetch the favicons from the top 500 websites and measure the time it took to retrive it. See the image for the outline of how the prossess will actually work. The goal of the MQP is to have people across the US load the page in order to gather the data and then use there IP on the server side to get there location. Maxmind is a service that provides a list of IP's and there corresponding location acrrosss the US.

Our team will consist of:

David Vollum (Front End)
Samual Goldmen (Client Server Interaction)
Evan Goldstein (Server)
